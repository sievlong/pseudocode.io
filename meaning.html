            What is Pseudocode?
        </h2>
        <p>
            We use pseudocode in various fields of programming, whether it be app development, data science or web development. Pseudocode is a technique used to describe the distinct steps of an algorithm in a manner that’s easy to understand for anyone with basic programming knowledge. Although pseudocode is a syntax-free description of an algorithm, it must provide a full description of the algorithm’s logic so that moving from pseudocode to implementation is merely a task of translating each line into code using the syntax of any given programming language.

        <h2>
            The main constructs of pseudocode
        </h2>
        <p>
            At its core pseudocode is the ability to represent six programming constructs (always written in uppercase): SEQUENCE, CASE, WHILE, REPEAT-UNTIL, FOR, and IF-THEN-ELSE. These constructs — also called keywords —are used to describe the control flow of the algorithm.
        </p>
        <p>
            1.  SEQUENCE represents linear tasks sequentially performed one after the other.<br>
            2.  WHILE a loop with a condition at its beginning.<br>
            3.  REPEAT-UNTIL a loop with a condition at the bottom.<br>
            4.  FOR another way of looping.<br>
            5.  IF-THEN-ELSE a conditional statement changing the flow of the algorithm.<br>
            6.  CASE the generalization form of IF-THEN-ELSE.<br>

            How to write Pseudocode
        </h2>
        <p>
            When writing pseudocode, everyone has their own style of presenting since humans are reading it and not a computer; pseudocode’s rules are less rigorous than that of a programming language. However, there are some simple rules that help make pseudocode more universally understood.
        </p>
        <p>
            1.  Always capitalize the initial word (often one of the main 7 constructs).<br>
            2.  Make only one statement per line.<br>
            3.  Indent to show hierarchy, improve readability, and show nested constructs.<br>
            4.  Always end multi-line sections using any of the END keywords (ENDIF, ENDWHILE, etc.).<br>
            5.  Keep your statements programming language independent.<br>
            6.  Use the naming domain of the problem, not that of the implementation. For instance: “Append the last name to the first name” instead of “name = first+ last.”<br>
            7.  Keep it simple, concise and readable.

        <h2>
            Why use Pseudocode?
        </h2>
        <p>
            - It's easier to read<br>
            - It simplifies code construction<br>
            - It's a good middle point between flowchart and code<br>
            - It's a helpful starting point for documentation<br>
            - It allows for quick bug detection
