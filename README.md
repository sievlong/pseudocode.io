Pseudocode Converter

"This website allows you to enter your pseudocode and convert it into Python code. I created this project during high school for one of my assessments. 
Currently, the converter doesn't use AI; it simply employs a basic word-by-word replacement function. 
However, in the future, I plan to develop it further to utilize AI for more accurate and efficient conversions."
